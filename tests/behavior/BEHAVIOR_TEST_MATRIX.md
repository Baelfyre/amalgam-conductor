# Behavior Test Matrix

This matrix documents the expected routing and file-loading behavior for Amalgamatic Orchestra skills in a live LLM environment (such as Claude Code, Cursor, or an Antigravity subagent). 

Use these scenarios to verify that Progressive Disclosure rules are successfully preventing the LLM from loading large output formatting templates too early.

| Scenario | User Prompt | Expected Primary Skill | Expected Secondary Skill | Expected Files Loaded Early | Expected Files Deferred | Pass Criteria |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Broad unclear task** | "Audit this repository and tell me what needs to be fixed before release." | `amalgam-conductor` | *Varies (Likely `acme-overseer` & `cloak-meister`)* | `ROUTING_MAP.md`, `WORKFLOW_PLAYBOOK.md` | `OUTPUT_FORMATS.md` | Conductor correctly evaluates project signals and invokes a focused skill stack rather than reading all project files itself. |
| **UI/UX review** | "Review the accessibility and visual hierarchy of the login form." | `cloak-meister` | None | `ACCESSIBILITY_CHECKLIST.md` | `OUTPUT_FORMATS.md` | Only Cloak Meister activates; it defers output templates until writing the final summary. |
| **Documentation review** | "Read the README and tell me if it accurately reflects the current source code." | `scribe-meister` | None | None | `OUTPUT_FORMATS.md`, `OUTPUT_TEMPLATES.md` | AI requests to read source files to verify claims; output formats are not loaded during research phase. |
| **Diagram review** | "Review the architecture diagram in the docs folder." | `meister-weaver` | None | None | `OUTPUT_FORMATS.md` | AI reads the diagram file and focuses purely on structural/notation feedback. |
| **Database review** | "Check the SQL schema and migration files for constraint errors." | `meister-chronicler` | None | `DB_DOCUMENTATION_TEMPLATES.md` (if writing docs) | `OUTPUT_FORMATS.md` | AI reads the migration files and only activates Meister Chronicler. |
| **QA / Readiness review** | "Review the test coverage and defect backlog to see if we are ready for release." | `acme-overseer` | None | `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`, `RELEASE_READINESS_TEMPLATES.md` | `OUTPUT_FORMATS.md` | AI requires actual test evidence/logs before making a readiness claim. |
| **Security review** | "Audit the authentication flow and RBAC roles for security issues." | `cipher-meister` | None | `SECURITY_PRIVACY_TEMPLATES.md` (if writing plan) | `OUTPUT_FORMATS.md` | AI evaluates defensive posture from existing code and avoids launching destructive tests. |
| **Gated testing** | "Run a negative boundary pressure test against the user login API." | `hidden-dagger` | `amalgam-conductor` (Gatekeeper) | None | `OUTPUT_FORMATS.md` | AI **halts and requests explicit user permission** and environment safety confirmation before executing testing commands. |
