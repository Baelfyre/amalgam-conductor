- [ ] Pre-state and post-state compared.
- [ ] Constraints and application behavior verified.
- [ ] No secrets exposed.

## OOP Refactor

### When to use
Use when a demonstrated responsibility, coupling, cohesion, inheritance, or layering problem blocks change or testing.

### Step-by-step execution
1. Trace the affected use case through current classes.
2. Identify the smallest concrete design problem.
3. Refactor without speculative interfaces or layers.
4. Compile and run the narrowest behavior check.

### Expected outputs
- Focused design finding, small diff, and regression evidence.

### Verification checklist
- [ ] Public behavior preserved unless change was requested.
- [ ] No unnecessary abstraction added.
- [ ] Dependency direction improved or unchanged.
- [ ] Focused tests pass.

## Quality Review

### When to use
Use for QA, testing, test plans or cases, defects, regression, smoke tests, acceptance criteria, verification, validation, quality gates, or release readiness.

### Required skills
- `acme-overseer`

### Step-by-step execution
1. Identify the quality objective and available test evidence.
2. Review requirements testability, acceptance criteria, test structure, and coverage.
3. Identify defect, regression, and release risks.
4. Recommend priority fixes and reproducible retest steps.

### Expected outputs
- Evidence-based quality review, missing evidence, priority fixes, and release recommendation.

### Verification checklist
- [ ] Test results and pass/fail claims are not invented.
- [ ] Missing evidence is marked.
- [ ] Hidden Dagger is not used as the normal QA route.

## Security and Privacy Review

### When to use
Use for security, privacy, data protection, authentication, authorization, RBAC, secrets, API or dependency risk, sensitive data, or secure SDLC review.

### Required skills
- `cipher-meister`; add Codex Security only when source-level scanning is required.

### Step-by-step execution
1. Identify protected assets, data, trust boundaries, and supplied evidence.
2. Review relevant authentication, authorization, sensitive data, secrets, dependencies, logging, and privacy controls.
3. Separate confirmed risks from assumptions and validate reachable paths when code is available.
4. Recommend defensive fixes, verification, and documentation updates.

### Expected outputs
- Security/privacy review, risk findings, missing evidence, and defensive remediation plan.

### Verification checklist
- [ ] No offensive exploit chain is produced.
- [ ] Vulnerabilities are not invented.
- [ ] Scanner claims are validated when a scanner is used.
- [ ] Privacy risks are separated from legal advice.

## Hidden Dagger Gated Resilience

### When to use
Recommend only for an explicitly requested adversarial test or a mature QA, staging, release-candidate, pre-production, or final-readiness project with high-risk gaps. Invoke only after the user chooses it and the safety gate passes.
