# Cipher Meister Quick Risk Review

Fictional example.

## Security or Privacy Objective
- Review a fictional invoice API's object-level authorization and validation.

## Evidence Reviewed
- API routes, request schema, service authorization function, and defensive integration tests.

## Confirmed Risks
1. Invoice list queries filter by account, but the single-invoice route uses only invoice identifier.
2. Update schema accepts a server-owned account identifier from the request body.

## Highest-Risk Gap
- Object ownership is not enforced consistently in the reviewed single-invoice path.

## Assumptions
- The repository does not apply an additional account filter; repository code was unavailable.

## Missing Evidence
- Gateway rate controls
- Repository query implementation
- Security-event logging

## Defensive Next Action
- Enforce ownership at the authoritative service or repository boundary and ignore server-owned fields from client input after approval.
