# Cipher Meister Quick Risk Review

Fictional example.

## Security or Privacy Objective
- Review project-level document access in a fictional collaboration platform.

## Evidence Reviewed
- Route definitions, authorization policy, role matrix, and repository query filters.

## Confirmed Risks
1. The read route checks membership; the update route checks only authentication.
2. The editor role matrix excludes deletion, but the delete policy accepts any member.

## Highest-Risk Gap
- Authenticated non-editors may reach update behavior under the reviewed policy.

## Assumptions
- No service-layer authorization check exists; service code was not supplied.

## Missing Evidence
- Integration tests for role boundaries
- Administrative override rules
- Audit-event configuration

## Defensive Next Action
- Confirm service-layer controls, centralize the intended policy, and add defensive role-boundary tests after approval.
