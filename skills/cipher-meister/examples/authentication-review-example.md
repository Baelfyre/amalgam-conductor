# Cipher Meister Quick Risk Review

Fictional example.

## Security or Privacy Objective
- Review password authentication and account recovery for a fictional scheduling service.

## Evidence Reviewed
- Authentication controller, password-hashing configuration, recovery-token model, and two defensive tests.

## Confirmed Risks
1. Recovery tokens have an expiry field but the reviewed validation path does not check it.
2. Login and recovery endpoints return different messages for unknown accounts.

## Highest-Risk Gap
- Expired recovery tokens may remain accepted according to the reviewed code path.

## Assumptions
- No upstream middleware performs expiry validation; middleware configuration was not supplied.

## Missing Evidence
- Rate-control configuration
- Production session settings
- Recovery audit events

## Defensive Next Action
- Confirm middleware behavior, enforce expiry at the authoritative validation boundary, and add a defensive expired-token test after approval.
