## Executive Summary
The order is easy to scan, but competing actions and poor proximity between the total and submission create avoidable checkout hesitation.

## Confirmed Findings
- `Place order` and `Continue shopping` use the same filled style.
- A promotional panel separates the final total from the submit action.

## Assumptions
- The screenshot represents the default desktop state; responsive and interaction states were not supplied.

## Critical Issues
None confirmed.

## Major Issues
### Competing actions obscure the next step
- Severity: Major
- Principle Applied: Visual hierarchy; Nielsen - recognition rather than recall
- Finding: `Place order` and `Continue shopping` have equal visual emphasis.
- Impact: Users can hesitate or choose the exit action accidentally.
- Recommendation: Reserve the filled style for `Place order` and use the existing secondary style for `Continue shopping`.
- Implementation Notes: Change the button variant only; preserve labels and checkout logic.

## Minor Issues
### Total lacks proximity to submission
- Severity: Minor
- Principle Applied: Gestalt principle of proximity
- Finding: Promotional content separates the total from the action that confirms it.
- Impact: Users must recheck which amount they are submitting.
- Recommendation: Place the final total immediately above the submit action.
- Implementation Notes: Reorder existing layout regions without introducing a new component.

## Strengths
- Product names, quantities, and prices align consistently.
- The edit-cart action is visible without dominating checkout.

## Quick Wins
- Demote `Continue shopping` to the secondary style.
- Move the total into the submission region.

## Long-Term Improvements
- Validate the revised hierarchy with a short task-based usability test.

## Accessibility Notes
Visible focus, keyboard order, accessible names, contrast values, and error announcements cannot be confirmed from the screenshot.

## Information Architecture Notes
The order summary follows the expected item-to-total sequence; the promotional panel interrupts the final confirmation group.

## Design Debt
The equal button styles suggest action hierarchy is not encoded consistently in the component usage.

## Frontend Implementation Notes
Reuse existing primary and secondary button variants and reorder existing layout regions; do not add components.

## Performance Notes
No performance problem is visible. Measure checkout rendering before proposing optimization.

## Missing Evidence
- Mobile layout
- Loading and error states
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen-reader behavior
- Component code

## Final Recommendation
Needs revision before release; the current structure does not require redesign.
