# Meister Chronicler Quick DB Review

## Database Objective
- Prevent invalid payroll-period records.

## Confirmed Issues
1. `period_end` can precede `period_start` because no check exists.
2. Duplicate employee-period rows are possible because no unique rule is shown.
3. `employee_id` is nullable although the workflow requires an employee.

## Highest-Risk Gap
- Duplicate payroll rows can produce conflicting payslips.

## Recommended Next Action
- Confirm the business rules and inspect existing violations before drafting approval-required constraints.
