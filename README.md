## About

Amalgamatic Orchestra is a portable AI workflow framework for coordinating specialist instruction files across different AI coding and review environments. It is designed to help an AI assistant route work to the right specialist, keep outputs focused, and preserve clear ownership across documentation, UI/UX, diagrams, database work, QA, security, and gated resilience testing.

The framework is Markdown-first so the core instructions can remain reusable across tools. Tool-specific adapters or plugins can be added later, but the repository does not depend on a single AI platform or plugin system.

## What this repository is

## Codex compatibility

The canonical Amalgamatic Orchestra skills remain metadata-rich. Codex may require simplified frontmatter.
Use `adapters/codex/` for Codex-compatible export and installation.
Repository-local `.agents/skills` installation is strongly recommended instead of modifying your global `.codex` directory.

## Getting Started

Amalgamatic Orchestra uses reusable Markdown instruction files to guide AI assistants through specialized project tasks while keeping responsibilities clear and separated.

The goal is to make AI-assisted project work easier to route, review, and verify. Instead of relying on one broad prompt for every task, this framework coordinates focused specialists. For example, one specialist handles UI/UX review, another handles documentation, another handles database review, and another handles QA readiness.

The main coordinating skill is **Amalgam Conductor**. It helps decide which specialist skill should be used, when multiple skills are needed, and what order they should be used in.

## What this repository is not

This repository is not a complete AI tool by itself. It does not automatically install into every IDE, chatbot, or local model environment.

It also does not include private project context, external plugins, or permission to perform risky actions. Any destructive, production-level, offensive, or pressure-testing activity must be reviewed and approved separately.

## Recommended routing flow

Use this flow when deciding which skill to apply:

1. Start with **Amalgam Conductor** if the task is broad, unclear, or involves multiple types of work.
2. Route the main task to one primary specialist.
3. Add another specialist only when there is a separate required output.
4. Use **Acme Overseer** for normal QA, validation, regression, and release-readiness review.
5. Use **Cipher Meister** for normal defensive security and privacy review.
6. Use **Hidden Dagger** only when the task is explicitly authorized, scoped, isolated from production, and includes rollback, cleanup, and stop conditions.

If the task is obvious, use the correct specialist directly.

## Installation

Amalgam Conductor can be installed directly as a plugin:

```sh
agy plugin install https://github.com/Baelfyre/amalgam-conductor
```


You can also use the framework manually by copying the skill folders from `skills/` into your AI environment's instruction directory.

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) and [adapters/](adapters/README.md) for more details.

## Plugin support

Amalgam Conductor acts as an installable plugin layer over the Amalgamatic Orchestra framework. It provides clean top-level commands to route tasks.

Manifest consistency can be checked with:
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\validate-manifest.ps1`
## Compatibility

This repository is designed to be Markdown-first. That means the core instructions are plain Markdown files that can be adapted across different AI coding environments.

Supported or adaptable workflows may include:

- Codex-compatible local skill folders
- VS Code AI workspace instructions or prompt references
- Antigravity local skill references or adapted Markdown
- Claude Code using the supplied CLAUDE template
- Local AI systems using `SKILL.md` files through prompt context or retrieval

This repository does not guarantee automatic discovery or native integration in every IDE, model runtime, or AI assistant. Tool-specific behavior depends on the current configuration and capabilities of that environment.

See [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) for more details.

## Git safety

Keep experimental AI instruction files separate from unrelated repositories.

If local instruction files must live inside a project, use `.git/info/exclude` for machine-local exclusions. Use `.gitignore` only when the exclusion should apply to every clone of the repository.

Before staging or committing changes, always check:

```sh
git status
```

## Test prompts

Use these prompts to check whether each skill is being interpreted correctly:

- Amalgam Conductor: `Use $amalgam-conductor to select the smallest skill stack for this task and explain the sequence.`
- Cloak Meister: `Use $cloak-meister to review this interface for task completion, accessibility, and responsive layout.`
- Scribe Meister: `Use $scribe-meister to audit this documentation against the supplied source files.`
- Meister Weaver: `Use $meister-weaver to review this sequence diagram against the supplied workflow.`
- Meister Chronicler: `Use $meister-chronicler to review this schema and migration for integrity and rollback risk.`
- Acme Overseer: `Use $acme-overseer to assess this test plan, regression evidence, and release readiness.`
- Cipher Meister: `Use $cipher-meister to review the supplied authentication, RBAC, secrets, and privacy evidence defensively.`
- Hidden Dagger: `Use $hidden-dagger to create a safety-gated negative-testing plan for this non-production system. Do not execute tests.`
- Clockwork Meister: `Use $clockwork-meister to review this codebase for OOP principles, layered architecture, and refactoring safety.`

## Validation

Run the structure validator, then run the stale-reference check.

PowerShell:

```powershell
./scripts/validate-structure.ps1
./scripts/check-stale-references.ps1
```

Shell:

```sh
sh ./scripts/validate-structure.sh
sh ./scripts/check-stale-references.sh
```

See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for the complete checklist.
