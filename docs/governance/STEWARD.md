# The Steward — Reference Summary

> **Authoritative behavior is defined in [`skills/the-steward/SKILL.md`](../../.agents/skills/the-steward/SKILL.md).** This document is a human-facing quick reference only. Do not use it as a behavior source of truth.

The Steward is the business alignment, scope, requirements, and SDLC governance authority. It sits above the Conductor and reviews every request before it reaches the Conductor.

## Quick Reference

| Decision | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `APPROVED` | Passes to the Governor |
| `REVISION_REQUIRED` | Returns to requester with findings |
| `BLOCKED` | Conductor cannot proceed |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE` | Trivial request, passes through |

**Risk levels**: `LOW` (objective and scope check), `MEDIUM` (full requirements and acceptance criteria), `HIGH` (stakeholder alignment, traceability, success metrics).

## Boundaries

- Does not implement features.
- Does not provide legal or compliance review (Governor's domain).
- Does not route work to execution skills.
- Cannot be overridden by the Governor.
- Does not assume any specific project context without evidence.
