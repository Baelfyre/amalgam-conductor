# Contributing

- Keep examples fictional, generic, and project-agnostic.
- Exclude private projects, personal data, local paths, credentials, and client details.
- Do not vendor external plugin code or claim unsupported compatibility or compliance.
- Do not add offensive security content or instructions for unauthorized access.
- Before starting a new local development phase or repository-editing session, run `python scripts/preflight_sync_check.py` against `origin/main`. Do not begin edits if the local branch is behind, diverged, dirty, or unverifiable. Ahead-only state may proceed, but the unpublished commits must be reported.
- Preserve specialist ownership, evidence-first findings, progressive disclosure, and local-first safety.
- Preserve Dagger's explicit activation, non-production requirement, approval gate, rollback, cleanup, and stop conditions.
- CI now runs `python scripts/governance_check.py --strict` for deterministic Stage 1 governance failures.
- `main` is governed by an active repository ruleset that requires pull requests, one approval, conversation resolution, and the required GitHub check contexts `governance-check`, `validate`, `Analyze (actions)`, and `Analyze (python)` before merge.
- Direct pushes to `main` are not part of the normal workflow. Use a branch and pull request unless you are the solo maintainer performing urgent recovery for ruleset repair, CI repair, or repository access recovery.
- Maintainer bypass remains enabled as a recovery path, not as the default development path. Document any bypass use afterward if it changes governance behavior, CI behavior, or release state.
- Signed commits and linear history currently exist in the repository ruleset, but signing readiness is still a follow-up maintainer workflow decision and Phase 7.5 does not change those settings.
- Phase 7.6 readiness guidance is documented in `docs/governance/SIGNED_COMMIT_READINESS.md`. Repo-local SSH signing is configured and verified on a test branch, so new documentation or code commits on this repository should use signed commits by default.
- Dependabot pull requests must still pass the required checks. Any future auto-merge decision should stay limited to low-risk patch or minor dependency updates and should exclude governance, workflow, plugin metadata, Dagger, and specialist routing changes.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for significant source, workflow, governance, documentation, skill, command, or security changes. If a changelog update is intentionally not needed, document why in the implementation report.
- Run the validation scripts before submitting changes.

## Standard contribution flow

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make the smallest relevant change set.
3. Run the local validation commands required for the task.
4. Commit with signing enabled.
5. Push the branch.
6. Open a pull request targeting `main`.
7. Wait for `governance-check`, `validate`, `Analyze (actions)`, and `Analyze (python)` to pass.
8. Resolve review conversations and obtain at least one approval.
9. Merge only after the required checks and review requirements are satisfied.

## Emergency maintainer recovery flow

1. Use bypass only for urgent recovery, failed ruleset repair, CI repair, or repository access recovery.
2. Make the smallest recovery change possible.
3. Restore the normal branch and pull-request workflow as soon as the repository is stable.
4. Document the bypass use afterward if repository governance or CI behavior was affected.
