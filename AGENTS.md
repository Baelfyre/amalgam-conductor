# Orchestra ecosystem Guidelines

When operating within this repository or when this plugin is active, adhere to the following routing and execution guidelines:

1. **Governance Layer**: `The Steward` (business alignment, scope, SDLC) and `The Governor` (legal, compliance, privacy, IP, licensing) sit above the Conductor. Governance review is dynamic, need-based, and adapts to the active operating mode (Ideation, Prototype, Implementation, Audit, Release). The Conductor cannot override governance decisions.
2. **Routing Layer**: `Conductor` is the exclusive router and workflow orchestrator. Do not invent custom subagent chains or bypass the Conductor for complex tasks.
3. **Implementation Layer**: `Ponytail` handles focused implementation, strictly keeping code minimal, reversible, and free of over-engineering.
4. **Communication Layer**: `Caveman` controls output compression to preserve context limits during long multi-file operations.
5. **Domain Specialists**: Specialists (`Clockwork`, `Cloak`, `Cipher`, `Chronicler`, `Weaver`, `Scribe`, `Overseer`, `Dagger`) exclusively own their respective domains.
6. **Source of Truth**: Do not guess specialist logic or rules. The authoritative source of truth for any skill's behavior is always located in its corresponding `skills/*/SKILL.md` file. Always defer to the explicit instructions in those files.
